# Project Sort

Throughout my time working with data it has always made me curious how sorting algorithms work, so now I am going to
begin to make my own package containing every method of sorting. If you would like to join in my efforts email me at the
contact page [here](https://github.com/makuraren/Sort/blob/main/README.md#contact) and let me know what you would like
to work on.
